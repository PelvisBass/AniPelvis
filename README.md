# AniPelvis
Until futher notice (hopefuly not super long) this github is dead. I am not encoding that often until I get my hands on a new cpu as it is a bit of a slog to encode with my current equipment. This should not tak very long, but until then most of these scripts are from when I was just getting started with encoding / subbing so they are all really horrible. That is your warning

All of my sub/encoding Work.
None of the translations belong to me but are public or from various fansub groups
If any group wants me to remove anything contact me at PelvisBass#8205 and I will
